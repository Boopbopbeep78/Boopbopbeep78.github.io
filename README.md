## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Boopbopbeep78/Boopbopbeep78.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Boopbopbeep78/Boopbopbeep78.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

Growth mindeset is continous improvement - like the Agile objective.  It's a state of mind that one must deploy to simply, grow.  The adage, "no pain, no gain" sums it up best.  By not seeing higher skilled individuals as threats, but, as inspiration, is the difference between having a growth mindeset and not so.

I can keep myself in a growth mindeset by:

1. continuously reminding myself that I can always improve
2. remembering that everyone has something to teach me
3. keeping good habits that prevent me from deviating from the growth mindset path
